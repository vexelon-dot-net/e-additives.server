Stabilizers, thickeners and gelling agents, like agar  or pectin  (used in jam for example) give foods a firmer texture. While they are not true emulsifiers, they help to stabilize emulsions. Emulsifiers allow water and oils to remain mixed together in an emulsion, as in mayonnaise, ice cream, and homogenized milk.</item>
